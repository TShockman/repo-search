# repo-search client

## setup instructions
* Ensure yarn is installed (`brew install yarn`, `apt-get yarn`, etc)
* Build the project: `yarn install`
* Start the client: `yarn start`

The client can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000


## testing
Run `yarn test` to run tests. Due to time constraints, only the Bookmarks module is properly tested, but it should give an idea as to my testing strategy.
